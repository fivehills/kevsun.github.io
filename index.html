## Professor of Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science
### College of Foreign Languages, Tongji University, China

I am a full professor of computational linguistics and cognitive science at the College of Foreign Languages, Tongji University, China. I have completed my Habilitation (professor qualification) and previously worked as a research scientist at the University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany. Before that, I held associate professor positions at two Chinese universities.

My research spans computational linguistics, deep learning, machine learning, and computational cognition, using both computational and experimental methodologies. I am proficient in Python, R, Java, and Linux Shell.
