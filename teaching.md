## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical applications. My teaching approach emphasizes hands-on experience with computational tools and methods, collaborative learning, and critical thinking. Students in my courses not only learn theoretical concepts but also gain practical skills in programming, data analysis, and research design that prepare them for careers in academia or industry.
