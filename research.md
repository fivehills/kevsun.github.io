# Research

My research spans multiple interconnected areas in computational linguistics, deep learning, machine learning, and computational cognition.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

My primary research focus is on fine-tuning and optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating their performance, and enhancing their reasoning capabilities. I work on developing:

- Evaluation frameworks for assessing LLM performance on complex linguistic tasks
- Fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific applications
- Techniques to enhance reasoning and logical capabilities in LLMs
- AI-driven multi-agent systems for collaborative problem solving

## Computational Linguistics

I am actively developing:

- Probabilistic multilingual discourse parsers using LLMs
- Linguistic databases and corpora for various research applications
- Open-source applications for detecting human emotion and cognition
- Tools for personality assessment and mental health detection from linguistic data

## Computational Cognition

My work in computational cognition focuses on:

- Convolution-based computational frameworks to model human language comprehension
- Prediction models for language production and multimodal processing
- Integration of automatic linguistic analysis with neurocognitive research
- Analysis of eye-tracking, EEG, and fMRI data for language processing studies

## Current Projects
